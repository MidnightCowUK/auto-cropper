# auto-cropper
A Python script that processes PNG images with transparency, automatically cropping them to the smallest power-of-2 dimensions that can contain the non-transparent content. This is particularly useful for optimizing sprite sheets, textures, and other game assets where power-of-2 dimensions are required.
